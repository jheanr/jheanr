- âš¡ Fun fact: To move my right foot upwards I've to think that I'm moving it laterally to left. **Why?** When I was 4, I was diagnosed with a paralysis on a muscle responsible for that moviment and other stuffs. 20 years later I did a procedure to amend it, so some nervers/muscle were arranged and that's why that my right foot react like this.
